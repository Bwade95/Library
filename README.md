# Library
## A HTML,CSS,JS based simple library webpage

Allows users to input books that include their; Title, Author, Pages, and whether or not the user has finished the book.
After users have input their book details the book is then stored on the webpage. Users can add multiple book and by clicking on the finished button
after submitting the book, users can switch between finished and not finished. They can also remove an added book by clicking the remove button.

**STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS**

I'm aiming to implement proper function of local storage so that when users return to the site they are able to recover previously stored book cards.
I'm also aiming to use firebase so that users can save their book cards onto the cloud, so when they access the webpage they can sign in and it will look through
the cloud for their books.
